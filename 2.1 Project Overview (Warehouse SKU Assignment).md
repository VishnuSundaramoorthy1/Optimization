# Warehouse SKU Assignment Optimization Model
#### This repository contains a supply chain optimization model implemented in Julia and data manipulation techniques in Python. 
#### The project focuses on warehouse selection, inventory management, and logistics planning to optimize supply chain operations efficiently.

## Project Overview
#### The project is divided into two major components:

## Warehouse Optimization using Julia
#### Objective: Assign parts to warehouses optimally to minimize lead time and reorder points (ROP) while maximizing part concentration.
#### Methodology:

#### ✔️ Integer Programming (IP) model implemented using JuMP and HiGHS/GLPK solvers.
#### ✔️ Binary decision variables where each part is assigned to exactly one warehouse.

#### Constraints:
#### ✔️ If customer concentration ≥ 80%, the part must be assigned to that warehouse.
#### ✔️ Ensures that each part is only assigned to a single warehouse.

#### Key Outputs:
#### ✔️ Optimal warehouse assignments for each part.

## Data Manipulation & Logistics Analysis in Python
#### Objective: Prepares, cleans, and processes sales, logistics, and inventory data for further modeling.

#### Key Steps:
#### ✔️ Reading & filtering sales data (Sales_History_Apodaca.csv).
#### ✔️ Merging & analyzing logistic data (US CAN ZIP CODE FILE 1.xlsx).
#### ✔️ Warehouse location analysis using geopy for distance calculations.
#### ✔️ Statistical modeling using scipy.stats.norm for demand analysis.

#### Key Outputs:
#### ✔️ Cleaned and processed sales, logistics, and inventory data.
#### ✔️ Visualizations for warehouse selection & lead time.

## Results & Insights
#### ✅ Optimized Warehouse Selection for demand fulfillment.
#### ✅ Minimized Lead Time & Inventory Holding Costs.
#### ✅ Automated Data Processing for sales & logistics analysis.
#### ✅ Scalable Supply Chain Decision-Making Model.

## Future Enhancements
#### 🔹 Dynamic Demand Forecasting using machine learning.
#### 🔹 Integrating Uncertainty Modeling for robust supply chain decisions.
#### 🔹 Adding Cost Optimization for Transportation & Inventory Balancing.
