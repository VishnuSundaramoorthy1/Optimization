Supply Chain Network Optimization using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
This repository contains a supply chain network optimization model implemented using JuMP in Julia with the HiGHS solver. 
The goal is to optimize a multi-echelon supply chain by minimizing operational costs while ensuring demand fulfillment across five regions.

🚀 Problem Overview
A company operates in five regions: Calopia, Sorange, Tyran, Entworpe, and Fardo, each with unique demand levels. 
The challenge is to strategically open factories and warehouses while optimizing:

Production & Capacity Planning 📈
Facility Location Decisions 🏭
Inventory Holding & Fulfillment 📦
Logistics & Transportation Costs 🚚
Demand Satisfaction ✅
🔍 Optimization Model
The MILP formulation optimizes total costs, including:

Fixed costs for opening factories and warehouses.
Variable production costs based on capacity.
Transportation costs for factory-to-warehouse and warehouse-to-customer shipments.
Holding costs for inventory storage.
🛠️ Key Features
✅ Binary Decision Variables for facility location selection (factory/warehouse).
✅ Capacity Constraints to ensure feasible production and storage levels.
✅ Flow Balance Constraints to maintain consistency across supply chain nodes.
✅ Big-M Formulation for warehouse operations and demand fulfillment.
✅ Automated Solver Execution using the HiGHS optimizer in JuMP.

📊 Results
Optimal cost computation considering facility, production, and logistics expenses.
Factory & warehouse selection based on cost-effectiveness.
Efficient distribution strategy to fulfill demand with minimal cost.
Dynamic production scheduling to prevent bottlenecks.
