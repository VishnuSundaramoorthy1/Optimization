# Supply Chain Network Optimization using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
#### This repository contains a supply chain network optimization model implemented using JuMP in Julia with the HiGHS solver. 
#### The goal is to optimize a multi-echelon supply chain by minimizing operational costs while ensuring demand fulfillment across five regions.

## Problem Overview
#### A company operates in five regions: Calopia, Sorange, Tyran, Entworpe, and Fardo, each with unique demand levels. 
#### The challenge is to strategically open factories and warehouses while optimizing:

#### Production & Capacity Planning
#### ✔️ Facility Location Decisions
#### ✔️ Inventory Holding & Fulfillment
#### ✔️ Logistics & Transportation Costs
#### ✔️ Demand Satisfaction

## Optimization Model
#### The MILP formulation optimizes total costs, including:

#### ✅ Fixed costs for opening factories and warehouses.
#### ✅ Variable production costs based on capacity.
#### ✅ Transportation costs for factory-to-warehouse and warehouse-to-customer shipments.
#### ✅ Holding costs for inventory storage.

## Key Features
#### ✅ Binary Decision Variables for facility location selection (factory/warehouse).
#### ✅ Capacity Constraints to ensure feasible production and storage levels.
#### ✅ Flow Balance Constraints to maintain consistency across supply chain nodes.
#### ✅ Big-M Formulation for warehouse operations and demand fulfillment.
#### ✅ Automated Solver Execution using the HiGHS optimizer in JuMP.

## Results
#### 📌 Optimal cost computation considering facility, production, and logistics expenses.
#### 📌 Factory & warehouse selection based on cost-effectiveness.
#### 📌 Efficient distribution strategy to fulfill demand with minimal cost.
#### 📌 Dynamic production scheduling to prevent bottlenecks.
